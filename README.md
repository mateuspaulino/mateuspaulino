I'm Mateus Paulino, a Tech Lead and Senior Software Engineer with over 12 years of experience in software development. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems and a Master's degree in Emerging Technologies in Education.

# üöÄ Expertise

I have a strong interest in solving complex problems and building scalable, high-performance systems. My focus is on front-end and full-stack development, and I've worked extensively with a wide range of technologies. As a Tech Lead, I've led various projects, collaborated with product and design teams, and maintained a steady hand in high-pressure situations.
